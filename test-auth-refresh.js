/**
 * Test script to verify automatic token refresh functionality
 * 
 * This script simulates what happens when a token expires:
 * 1. It makes an API call that should succeed
 * 2. It simulates a token expiration by corrupting the token
 * 3. It makes another API call that should trigger token refresh
 * 4. It verifies that the refresh worked and the call succeeded

// Note: This is a conceptual test script. In a real scenario, you would:
// 1. Set up a test environment with a short token expiration time
// 2. Wait for the token to naturally expire
// 3. Make API calls to verify automatic refresh

🧪 Token Refresh Test Plan
=========================

To test the automatic token refresh functionality:

1. **Setup**: Make sure you have valid credentials stored in localStorage:
   - jellyfin-server-url
   - jellyfin-username  
   - jellyfin-password

2. **Normal Operation**: 
   - Log into the app normally
   - Use the app to verify everything works

3. **Simulate Token Expiration**:
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Go to Application > Cookies
   - Find the 'jellyfin-auth-token' cookie
   - Modify its value to something invalid (e.g., add 'INVALID' to the end)
   - Or delete the cookie entirely

4. **Test Automatic Refresh**:
   - Try to perform any action that requires API calls:
     - View playlists
     - Create a playlist
     - Add songs to a playlist
     - Search for music
   
5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The first API call should fail with 401/403
   - The auth client should detect this and attempt token refresh
   - A new authentication request should be made using stored credentials
   - The cookie should be updated with a new valid token
   - The original API call should be retried and succeed
   - The user should not be redirected to the login page

6. **Verify Success**:
   - Check browser dev tools console for refresh messages:
     - "🔑 Auth error detected, attempting token refresh..."
     - "🔄 Attempting to refresh authentication token..."
     - "✅ Token refresh successful"
     - "🔄 Token refreshed, retrying operation..."
   - Check that the cookie has a new value
   - Verify that the UI operation completed successfully

7. **Test Failure Scenario**:
   - Temporarily change stored credentials to invalid values
   - Repeat steps 3-4
   - Expected: User should be logged out and redirected to login page

📝 Implementation Details:
- All Jellyfin API methods are wrapped with authClient.withTokenRefresh()
- Token refresh uses stored credentials from localStorage
- Failed refresh triggers automatic logout and redirect
- Multiple concurrent requests are handled with a single refresh attempt
